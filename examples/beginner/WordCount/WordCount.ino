 * This example sketch shows how to count the words MOVI heard.  One can get 
 * the bare words recognized (and visible in the Serial Monitor) by catching 
 * the RAW_WORDS event and then using the method getResult(). 
 * Then, we just count the words. The event SILENCE tells us no words. 
 *
 * Circuitry:
 * Arduino UNO R3, MEGA2560 R3, or Arduino Leonardo R3.
 * Connect speaker to MOVI.
 * IMPORTANT: Always use external power supply with MOVI. 
 * 
 * Other Arduino-compatible boards:  
 * Consult MOVI's User Manual before connecting MOVI.
